// This package operates, internally, on Jacobian coordinates. For a given
// (x, y) position on the curve, the Jacobian coordinates are (x1, y1, z1)
// where x = x1/z1² and y = y1/z1³. The greatest speedups come when the whole
// calculation can be performed within the transform (as in ScalarMult and
// ScalarBaseMult). But even for Add and Double, it's faster to apply and
// reverse the transform than to operate in affine coordinates.
